Warning, you need a Redmi Note 8 Ginkgo and rooted and you will lose all files, system, etc.

click on the link to download: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oja2kVDYmTsz-PHnKczR5X5nJ6DHVvl0/view?usp=drive_link

Download the file from Google Drive, extract it, and flash the "ProjectSakura.zip" file, and then the "kernel-nethunter.zip" file.

Turn on the phone and if everything goes well, the screen to configure the system for the first time will appear, do it, then download and install "Magisk-v24.3.apk", then in the Magisk gear activate Zygisk and restart the device.

open magisk and flash the modules "nethunter.zip" and "wifiNH.zip", in magisk and after finishing restart the device, and if everything goes well open Fdroid to update the apps, nethunter, nethunter terminal,
and then open nethunter and see if in kernel version the first line appears Team420-GW-Nethunter-Q-1.2, if it appears it is because everything went well, if something else appears open the recovery mode again and flash the "kernel-nethunter.zip",
again, restart the system and see if it appeared in the kernel, now just use the nethunter features.

Remembering the network card of the Redmi Note 8/T8 is very bad for network attacks, it does not have the power to take down or make an Evil Twin, use a wifi adapter to attack, one that is compatible in this list, note: this list is based on the module "WifiNh.zip":
